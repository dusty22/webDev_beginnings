Your task here is simple.

Read through the two HTML files (comments and all) as well as the third file that
gives you some tips for working with Cloud9 and bug fixing on web pages.

The first HTML file gives you a basic introduction to what CSS, HTML, and Javascript
are in their essences, whereas the second file shows you some slightly more fancy
usage of the three.
