Be careful when working with Cloud9 and your HTML files.

Issue: My changes aren't appearing when I run the webpage!

Solution: 
Hit F5 in most browsers to do a full page-reload, since your browser will
cache and keep old files. Make sure you hit save in Cloud9.


Issue: I can't figure out what's wrong!

Solution: 
Right click on your webpage, hit Inspect. Then go to Console.
Here you will see errors in your files and at which line. Among other
information.


Issue: I'm getting a 404 Page Not Found!

Solution:
Make sure you are only trying to host one HTML file at a time.
Make sure you didn't move the files somewhere else on C9, if you did,
start a new runner that points to the right file.
