This is a crash course designed to get your foot in the door for web development.

The course mostly focuses on client-side web engineering which means you will mostly
be learning about HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), 
and Javascript.

A little bit about server-side concepts like databases and hosting are touched on,
but will mostly be left to your later ventures.

Topics touched on:
- basic HTML, CSS, Javascript
- using newer features in Javascript (2015 standard)
- relation between Javascript and Java
- using Firebase, a relatively new platform by Google that's useful for web development
- asynchronous vs. synchronous code
- HTML5 features
