Try Curtis' Angular Javascript workshop:
- In the workshop, you are given two versions of an example to-do list web app, one version made in Angular 1, the other in Angular 2.

- Notice Curtis created his webpage for the workshop using RevealJS (https://github.com/CurtisKreidler/reveal.js), a Javascript library that lets you make webpages structured like slide shows.

- Navigate using arrows in the lower-right corner (be sure to use the down arrow so you don't miss important content)

Other Notes:
- Angular is a Javascript framework (a framework is a slightly different way of thinking compared to using a library)

- In theory, you can do everything a framework does in plain Javascript, but the framework is intended to make things much easier, just like a library

- Angular is useful for web applications (for example, a calculator, as opposed to a website) because it makes your website more modular. Certains components of a page can be reloaded without reloading the entire webpage for better performance.


Where else to go:
- Start learning about other Javascript frameworks and libraries that exist

- Learn about server-side web coding languages like PHP, and nodeJS:
-- these languages can pre-process HTML, CSS, and Javascript files before serving them to a client, and more.  -- PHP syntax has some similarities to Javascript. 
-- NodeJS's main purpose is doing what PHP does but using Javascript instead of PHP as your language.

- Professor Novocin's client-side engineering class: "http://css.prof.ninja/"
-- do this some or all of this class if you want to take your client-side skills to the next level
